In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with objects that are not properly retained or released.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  Consider this example: 

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

- (void)someMethod {
    MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    obj.myString = @"Hello";
    // Missing release or autorelease!
}
```

The `MyClass` object is allocated, but never released. If `someMethod` is called multiple times, memory usage will increase until the app crashes.  The `dealloc` method is called when an object is deallocated, but because the object is never released, the `NSLog` statement will never be executed, making it difficult to track down these types of memory leaks.
